  We chose to make an web application for a restaurant which can deliver food at home. If the user does not already have an account, the he goes to the register page and enters the required data. After he submits the form, the system verifies if the data is correct. If so, the user is redirected to the menu page in which he can shuffle through all the products. After he selects the products that he wants to buy, the quantity and presses the buy button, the user receives a confirmation for his purchase.
